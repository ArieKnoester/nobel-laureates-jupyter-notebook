Work in progress.

## NOTE: 

Graphs created using plotly do not render on GitHub. They can be viewed by copying the URL for the .ipynb file in this repo and using [NBViewer](https://nbviewer.org/)
or by using [this link](https://nbviewer.org/github/ArieKnoester/nobel-laureates-jupyter-notebook/blob/main/Nobel_Prize_Analysis.ipynb).
Plotly graphs should render and hover data should work.
